# Current Weather App

A Front-End Weather App created with React, Scss, and Axios. The app connects to the OpenWeather API, which provides real-time weather data to the user.

# Location of deployed application:

The application is deployed on Netlify and can be visited here:

- https://current-weather-by-dj.netlify.app/

# Instructions to run locally:

- Clone this repository. Cd into the project folder, and run `npm install`.

- You will require an API key from OpenWeather to use this locally. You can easily get a free API key here(Use the Current Weather Data API Key):

- https://openweathermap.org/api

- Once you have your API key, create a `.env` file to store your key. Look at the existing `.env.example` file as a template if you are unsure of how to do this.

Once dependencies have been installed, and you have acquired your own OMDB API key (as well as the `.env` file), you can now run `npm start` to start the application locally on `Port 3000`.

- Dependencies include:

  - React - ^17.0.1
  - Node-Sass - ^4.14.1
  - Axios - ^0.21.1

Of course you may also just visit the deployed application on Netlify here:
